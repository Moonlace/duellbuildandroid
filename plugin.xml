    Use this plugin to build for the android platform. Current limitations are mainly that only armv7 architecture is properly working, meaning currently there isn't the possibility to build for x86 or mips.

	<configuration>
		<elem name="icon">
			Use this to configure where the icon files are. By default they are searched in current_project_path/Icons/ios. The naming and sizing is very strict due to how ios works. To know them, just do a "duell create emptyProject" and see the icons that are on the default project. E.g.: &lt;icon path="Iconys/ios" /&gt;. 
		</elem>

		<elem name="architecture">
			Use this tag to specify an architecture that the app should be built with. By default armv7 is used. If you run in the simulator, x86 is overridden automatically. If you want to build for armv6 you can specify that here. E.g.: &lt;architecture name="armv6" /&gt;. 
		</elem>

		<elem name="hxcpp-compilation-arg">
			*WARNING Currently this is not working properly* Use this tag if you want to pass an additional compilation argument to the hxcpp compilation of the generated c++ code. E.g.: &lt;hxcpp-compilation-arg value="armv6" /&gt;. 
		</elem>

		
		<elem name="fullscreen">
			Use this to specify if you want to hide the status bar. By defualt it is hidden. E.g.: &lt;fullscreeen value="true" /&gt;. 
		</elem>
		
		<elem name="orientation">
			Use this to specify the orientations you allow on the app. Possible values are UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft, UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight, UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait, UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown. By default all orientations are allowed. E.g.: &lt;orientation value="UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft,UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight" /&gt;. 
		</elem>
		
	</configuration>

	<arg name="-debug" type="void">
		<documentation>
			Use this argument if you want to build in debug.
		</documentation>
	</arg>

	<arg name="-fulllogcat" type="void">
		<documentation>
			Use this argument if you want to see the complete logcat as opposed to seeing a filtered one. The default filters are "duell", "Main", "DuellActivity", "GLThread" and "trace"
		</documentation>
	</arg>

	<arg name="-signedrelease" type="void">
		<documentation>
			Use this argument if you want to sign the resulting apk.
